MetalKit
Utility functionality for Metal Apps


## Metal Performance Shaders | Anna Tikhonova | 2815 | p165


A framework of data-parallel algorithms for the GPU

CPU-style library for the GPU


Optimized for iOS

Available in iOS 9 for the A8 processor

Designed to integrate easily into your  Metal applications

As simple as calling a library function


### Supported image operators

- Histogram, Equalization, and Specification
- Morphology—Min, Max, Dilate, and Erode Lanczos Resampling
- Median
- Thresholding
- Integral
- Convolution—General, Gaussian Blur, Box, Tent, and Sobel


```
Use a ‘blur’ filter
// Create a filter object
MPSImageGaussianBlur *blurFilter =
    [[MPSImageGaussianBlur alloc]
    initWithDevice: device sigma: 3];
// Encode filter to the command buffer
[blurFilter encodeToCommandBuffer: commandBuffer
    source: sourceTexture
    destination: destinationTexture];
```

### Performance

- Behind the scenes
- Choose the right algorithm
- Tune for
- Kernel radius
- Pixel format
- Memory hierarchy
- Number of pixels per thread Threadgroup dimensions
- CPU optimizations


### In-place Operation

How?
```
// Encode filter in-place in a Metal command buffer
[blurFilter encodeToCommandBuffer: commandBuffer
    inPlaceTexture: sourceTexture
    fallbackCopyAllocator: myAllocator];
```
It’s not always possible for Metal Performance Shaders filters to run in-place
Depends on filter, filter parameters and properties
Copy allocator will create a destination texture, so operation can proceed out-of-place

### Fallback Copy Allocator
Example


```
MPSCopyAllocator myAllocator = ^id <MTLTexture>(
    MPSKernel * filter,
    id <MTLCommandBuffer> commandBuffer,
    id <MTLTexture> sourceTexture)
{
    MTLTextureDescriptor * desc = descriptorFromTexture(sourceTexture);
    id <MTLTexture> destinationTexture = [commandBuffer.device
        newTextureWithDescriptor: desc];
    return destinationTexture;
};
```
