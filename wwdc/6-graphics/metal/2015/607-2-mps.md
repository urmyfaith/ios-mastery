## [Metal Performance Shaders](607-2-mps.md) | Anna Tikhonova | 2815 | p165


A framework of data-parallel algorithms for the GPU

CPU-style library for the GPU


- Optimized for iOS
- Available in iOS 9 for the A8 processor
- Designed to integrate easily into your  Metal applications
- As simple as calling a library function


### Supported image operators

- Histogram, Equalization, and Specification
- Morphology—Min, Max, Dilate, and Erode
- Lanczos Resampling
- Median
- Thresholding
- Integral
- Convolution—General, Gaussian Blur, Box, Tent, and Sobel


Use a ‘blur’ filter

```
// Create a filter object
MPSImageGaussianBlur *blurFilter =
    [[MPSImageGaussianBlur alloc]
    initWithDevice: device sigma: 3];

// Encode filter to the command buffer
[blurFilter encodeToCommandBuffer: commandBuffer
    source: sourceTexture
    destination: destinationTexture];
```

### Performance - Behind the scenes

- Choose the right algorithm
- Tune for
  - Kernel radius
  - Pixel format
  - Memory hierarchy
  - Number of pixels per thread
  - Threadgroup dimensions
- CPU optimizations

### A Few More Details

#### Source ‘offset’ and Destination ‘clipRect’
Filter properties



### In-place Operation

How?
```
// Encode filter in-place in a Metal command buffer
[blurFilter encodeToCommandBuffer: commandBuffer
    inPlaceTexture: sourceTexture
    fallbackCopyAllocator: myAllocator];
```

- It’s not always possible for Metal Performance Shaders filters to run in-place
- Depends on filter, filter parameters and properties
- Copy allocator will create a destination texture, so operation can proceed out-of-place

### Fallback Copy Allocator

Example


```
MPSCopyAllocator myAllocator = ^id <MTLTexture>(
    MPSKernel * filter,
    id <MTLCommandBuffer> commandBuffer,
    id <MTLTexture> sourceTexture)
{
    MTLTextureDescriptor * desc = descriptorFromTexture(sourceTexture);
    id <MTLTexture> destinationTexture = [commandBuffer.device
        newTextureWithDescriptor: desc];

    // Use Metal encoder to initialize the destinationTexture from
    // sourceTexture, if necessary

    return destinationTexture;
};
```
