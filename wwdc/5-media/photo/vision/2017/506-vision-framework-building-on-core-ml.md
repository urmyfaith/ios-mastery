## What Can Vision Do

* Face Landmarks, smaller face, strong profile,
  * Face Landmarks
* Image Registration
* Rectangle Detection
* Barcode Detection
* Text Detection
* Object Tracking
  * For faces, rectangles, and general templates
* Integration with Core ML

### On Devices vs. Cloud

## The code



```swift
// Create request
 let = VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest()
faceDetectionRequest
// Create request handler
let myRequestHandler =
// send the requests to the request handler
(url: fileURL, options: [:])
VNImageRequestHandler
myRequestHandler.perform([faceDetectionRequest])
// Do we have a face
for observation in faceDetectionRequest.results as! [VNFaceObservation] { }

```

### Sequence

```swift
// Create a sequence request handler
let requestHandler = ()
let observations = detectionRequest. as! [VNDetectedObjectObservation]
let objectsToTrack = observations.map { VNTrackObjectRequest(detectedObjectObservation: $0) }
// Run the requests
requestHandler.perform(objectsToTrack, on: pixelBuffer)
// Lets look at the results
for request in objectsToTrack
for observation in request.results as! [VNDetectedObjectObservation]
```



## Best Practices


Envisioning a Vision Task

* which image type is right for me?
* what am i going to do with the image?
* what performance do I need or want?

### Which Image Type Is Right for Me?

* Vision supports various image types
  * CVPixelBufferRef CGImageRef CIImage
  * NSURL
  * NSData
* The image type to choose depends on where the image comes from
* You shouldnâ€™t have to pre-scale the image
* Make sure to pass in the EXIF orientation of the image

## Everything streaming

CVPixelBuffer


## Files from Disk or Web
