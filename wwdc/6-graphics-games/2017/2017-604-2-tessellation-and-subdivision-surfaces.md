## [Tessellation and Subdivision Surfaces](2017-604-2-tessellation-and-subdivision-surfaces.md)




* How . works
* New Tessellation-based geometry APIs
* Subdivision Surfaces


### Motivation

Asset comes as a low-resolution model (coarse mesh)
Decreased memory bandwidth
High resolution model generated from the coarser model
High resolution model not stored in memory Generated on-the-fly by the GPU
Control over the amount of detail generated

### Subdivision Surfaces

```swift
let scene = try! SCNScene()


```

### Demo
