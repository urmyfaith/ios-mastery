## Design Goals.

Let's face this. If you do not set or define any goals for your work or life, you will go nowhere. Setting the goals high can drive you better, even you cannot meet it after serious attempts.


## Design Principle

We are civilized and educated people, we think logically, we are engineers. Unlike artists, counting on uncertainties for their creativities (no offense), we want to discover and solve the problems in predictable ways. We need both our brain/hands and tools.

In another view, as you feel secure to work with a person with integrity and principles, a software design with principles is also appreciated by software engineers. Here are some software design principles.

* [Design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)
* [SOLID Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), as part of [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
* Methodologies from algorithms design.

I wish I was told these in university time... You know, it seems to be gained only through experiences from projects.

## Design Review

Design Review can benefit both quality of product and growth of team members.
