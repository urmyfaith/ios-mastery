## Tips


In Xcode's breakpoint navigator, set the following global breakpoints

* Exception breakpoints (All = Objective-C and C)
* Swift breakpoint
* Test failure breakpoint



Test negative cases.

Test in non-ideal situations, such as offline (limited or unstable network bandwidth).
* non-office environment. such as walking, taking subway (no signal)
* testing by others (not developers, maybe your friends and family members, strangers..)

## Unit App Testing

Unit Test or UI Unit Test are very limited with environment variety. It can be used only in Xcode.
