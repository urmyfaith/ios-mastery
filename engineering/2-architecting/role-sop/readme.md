# Role and SOP (Standard Operation Procedure)

## Roles and Responsibility for types(protocol, classes, structs, etc)

Organizations defines job roles and responsibilities for its human resources, it makes everybody's work easy. Such great mentality has never entered complicated code world, until now to you. This system has been adopted and continuously revised since 2011. IKEA makes your house tidy, and R&R makes your code. 

## SOP

### People vs Process

It is widely agreed upon, that software development is people oriented, compared with factory job as process oriented.

However, I would argue this, for the errors that software engineers introduced are far easier and more costly. They think they can do it and do it in his own way. They do not care about the final and overall quality of their product until too late. That is human tragedy.

Process, or Best Practices commonly called in coding realm, is absolutely necessary for both quality and productivity. That is why I introduced SOP for coders. It is a written experience, just like people casually shared. It tells you not only *how* to do but also *why* to do it this way, backed with *goal-principle* paradigm.
