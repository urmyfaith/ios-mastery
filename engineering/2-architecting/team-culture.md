# Team Culture and Product Quality

Team Culture is important for many aspects, such as
* Members' loyalty,
* Members' productivity, and of courses
* Product Quality

## A team with consensus (on practices)

Practices means how we do things, which directly impact the quality of our product. However, by nature, people do things differently. Some of one's practice is better than of other's, that is the opportunity we can learn from each other.

Do not make it stop learning-from-each-other at individuals level, the whole team should have regular mutual sharing sessions.


### Group discussion on best practices, and establish and follow the team best practices.

Write them down.

### Arts vs Science

> Where to draw the line between respecting individuals' style and enforcing team principles.

Establishing the measurement on overall quality, which product delivery quality (functional and non-functional requirements) is just part of it.


After the measurement has been established and reviewed, we use it to check our coding practices. If the result is positive, go for it and promote at team scope; if negative, deeper discussion should take place.

iOS technology has its own depth and width. Being an expert at all aspect is not easy, due to time and attention constraints for a person. Team collaboration is absolutely necessary.

## Team work improves the internal quality.

If you worked alone, covering both UI and IO coding work, basically you were talking to yourself, the interface between UI and IO is likely to be blurred. If you worked with a team member, that each of you pick either UI or IO, then you two will talk to make the interface, like a contract, that each of you on one end of it.
