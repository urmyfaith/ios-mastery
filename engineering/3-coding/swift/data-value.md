# Data Value Types

Value here, refers to scale values, or primitives.

* symbol, in the form of enum or strings
* bool
* numeric
  * count - Int
  * measurement (with unit). Better understanding it in Foundation's Measurement

## Operators for types.

We can view operators as a syntax sugar for data transform functions. 

There are 2 types of operators, by the resulting values.

* Bool value, that can be used as condition for control flow. that is what I called control data.
* Derived value, that unit can be same or related.
