# iOS Mastery

## Forewords

I want to enjoy life, with software engineering career, in the fastest paced industry of iOS app development. I try to make it possible by both (1) taking advantages of my industrial experience asserts of 17 years and (2) staying foolish and hungry - in learning. The only way-out I can find is to write them down. Here you go.

I am transferring my local and html-based docs onto GitHub and markdown-based ones. Please stay tuned.

## Scope

* [Swift](swift), [language](swift/lang) & [stdlib](swift/stdlib)
* Apple-provided (non-third-party) iOS [frameworks](frameworks) and technologies, reformatted as my notes/cheatsheets on API reference, usage, cookbooks, and programming procedure.
* watchOS
* [My WWDC notes](wwdc)
* Xcode family and command-line tools
* Home-brew iOS apps architecture and methodologies.
* Coding Practices
* Topics on Software [Quality](quality) and Complexity
  * On [Performance](quality/performance) and Optimizations
  * On Testing, Debugging, Profiling
* Random thoughts on software.

### Out Of Scope

* Objective-C
* Open-source projects on iOS. I took them none.
* macOS, tvOS
* Server-side Swift
